	<h2>Monkeys? I like monkeys!</h2>
	<p>And so do we! <a href="#faqs">Monkeys</a> are really good &ndash; you can
	train them to do simple jobs, and they'll keep doing them over and over;
	you can even have lots of monkeys doing their jobs at the same time!
	<p>Here at Boom Towers, we have a large collection of monkeys. Normally,
	having lots of monkeys in a small space would be a recipe for trouble &ndash;
	but fear not! We have used our (slightly) more advanced brains to come
	up with a system for managing them. Today, we offer this technology to
	you &ndash; you too can become a Monkey Lord!
</div>

<div id="hello-world">
	<h2>Yes! I want to be a Monkey Lord!</h2>
	<p>Great! First, we will need a couple of monkeys:
	<p>Monkey number one: let's train him to do a really simple task - just
	have it take a look at the front page of our website:
	<!--#include file="monkeys/frontpage.py.html"-->
	<p>Monkey number two has a slightly more intricate job to do; it will
	log into our website, post a new story, and then update that story.
	<!--#include file="monkeys/upload.py.html"-->
	<p>With our two test-monkeys prepared, let's head over to the website
	and see how they handle it...
</div>

<div id="extras">
	<h2>Do these monkeys come pre-trained with cool tricks?</h2>
	<p>They sure do!
	<ul>
	<li>All basic monkeys come with the skills needed to interact with a
	website; they can GET things to read, POST updates, and even upload files.
	<li>Monkeys can paint! In order to keep a fresh supply of unique files,
	our monkeys are trained to create semi-random PNG images.
	<li>You can breed monkeys too! If you find that you need a lot of monkeys
	with the same basic skills, you can create one parent monkey with those
	skills, and then a set of children who use them in different ways.
	<!-- <li>With the right training, monkeys can do much more than just prodding
	web servers! While the ones we supply are bred for web work, you have the
	entire Python standard library at your disposal &ndash; you could train them
	to send emails, add data to your database, or just chill out and listen
	to your music collection. -->
	<li>Monkey Swarm makes an <i>excellent</i> companion for <a href="/context">Context</a> -
	with a hundred monkeys bashing away at your front end, giving you warnings
	like "Page X is unusually slow", you can use Context to look at Page X
	and see precisely what's happening under the hood.
	(<a rel="lightbox" title="The results of a Monkey Swarm attacking Civicboom" href="context/monkeys.800.png">Screenshot</a>).
	<li>Once the monkeys are all tired out, the statistics that they've gathered
	can be charted for an easier overview
	(<a rel="lightbox" title="Time Chart view" href="monkeys/chart.png">Screenshot</a>).
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="demo">
	<h2>That's pretty cool, let me have a go!</h2>
	<p>If you're convinced already and want to start using it for your commercial
	sites, you can skip straight down to <a href="#get-it">buy the commercial
	version</a>; if you want to get to know it a bit better first, try the
	personal use / evaluation version, and then follow along with the examples.

</div>

<div id="example1">
	<h2>Can I see how this works on a real problem?</h2>
	<p>Sure, here's a relatively simple example of how I've used it myself:

	<p>To start with, we have a theory that the profile page is slow; it runs
	~14 moderately heavy database queries on every page load and there is no
	caching at all.

	<p><b>Step 1:</b> Confirm our suspicion that the page really is slow.

	<p>It can be very tempting to optimise based on what you think <i>should</i>
	be slow, rather than looking at what <i>is</i> slow. So let's make a little
	monkey who loads the profile page and records how fast it loads.

	<!--#include file="monkeys/profile.py.html"-->

	<p>with this simple monkey trained, we can run it a few times:

<pre>
$ ./monkey-swarm --tribe civicboom --monkey profile -r 5 -w

[...]

---- Results:
   num    min    max    ave    h/s    url
     5  1.244  1.323  <b>1.263</b>   0.79  GET /profile
     5  0.059  0.091  0.080  12.44 POST /account/signin.json
    10  0.059  1.323  0.672   6.61 
</pre>

	<p>So we see that signing in takes an average of 0.08 seconds, but then
	loading the user's profile takes 1.26 &ndash; if we define "acceptable" as
	"under one second", then it is clear that users have a problem as soon
	as they log in. (Our live server is about 4x as fast as my testing
	laptop, but even then, 0.31s has room for improvement)


	<p><b>Step 2:</b> Make a guess at a solution.

	<p>Those who use Civicboom will see that our profile page has two parts &ndash;
	on the left side of the screen is the user's private information, articles,
	to-do lists, etc. On the right side of the screen is a list of featured
	articles &ndash; the latest questions, most active discussions, most viewed
	stories, etc. Since the information there is all totally public, and it
	doesn't matter if it is a few minutes out of date, what happens if we cache it?

	<p>(Shish goes away and adds the <code>@cacheable</code> decorator to the
	featured content list)

	<p><b>Step 3:</b> Test that our solution actually helps.

<pre>
$ ./monkey-swarm --tribe civicboom --monkey profile -r 5 -w

[...]

---- Results:
   num    min    max    ave    h/s    url
     5  0.620  0.730  <b>0.648</b>   1.54  GET /profile
     5  0.056  0.081  0.068  14.62 POST /account/signin.json
    10  0.056  0.730  0.358   8.08 
</pre>

	<p>Hooray, we have doubled the speed of the profile page, and we have some
	hard numbers proving that we aren't just imagining the improvement \o/
</div>

<div id="example2">
	<h2>Loading one page? That's easy, show me something hard</h2>
	<p>Ok, here are some more advanced monkeys, part of our Civicboom testing
	tribe:
	<p>A monkey that looks at our API to find the most recently posted articles,
	then picks a few at random to look at:
	<!--#include file="monkeys/browse_content.py.html"-->
	<p>A monkey who generates a random image to attach to an article:
	<!--#include file="monkeys/post_image.py.html"-->
	<p><a rel="lightbox" title="Results \o/" href="monkeys/example2.png">Results</a> /o/

	<h2>FAQs</h2>
	<h3>Isn't this animal cruelty?</h3>
	<p>These are not actual real monkeys in the mammal sense of the word!
	The monkeys we are using are software monkeys &ndash; short bits of code
	designed to autonomously interact with other computer systems.

	<h3>What platforms do the monkeys run on?</h3>
	<p>Recent versions of Windows, Linux, and OSX are natively supported.
	<p>To be exact:
	<ul>
		<li>Windows - XP or newer (tested on XP and win7)
		<li>Linux - Ubuntu 11.04 and newer (other / older distros should work
		fine, and the windows version works in WINE)
		<li>OSX - Intel 10.6+ (Also, the windows version works acceptably under WINE)
	</ul>

<div id="comparisons">
	<h2>I already have a box of hammers, why do I need a screwdriver?</h2>
	<h3>Why shouldn't I just use ApacheBench / Siege / etc?</h3>
	<p>These tools are great for testing web <i>servers</i>, they tell you
	how long it takes to create a TCP connection, how many bytes per second get
	transferred, etc. They aren't so great for testing web <i>sites</i>
	though &mdash; Monkey Swarm will interact with your site at a higher level,
	logging in, browsing pages, uploading new data, etc.

	<h3>How does this compare to Selenium?</h3>
	<p><a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" target="blank">Selenium</a> uses one virtual user at a time, checking that your website
	<i>works correctly</i>; Monkey Swarm runs many virtual users and checks
	that your website <i>performs well at scale</i>. We recommend using both
	of them together, as both aspects are important for success.

	<h3>What about Charles?</h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/" target="blank">Charles</a>
	<i>analyses</i> your web traffic, Monkey Swarm <i>creates</i> traffic.
	As above, both of these levels are important to understand, so we
	recommend using both tools.
