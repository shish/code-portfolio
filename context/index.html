	<h2>Can you see what it is yet?</h2>
	<p>If you get the general idea from one screenshot and want to go straight
	to making it work, skip to the next section; for a detailed explanation of
	what's happening, read on...

	<p>The main Context view shows a chart of time vs. activity; time along the
	top (defaulting to 1000 pixels per second, though you can quickly zoom in
	and out), and activity (grouped by thread / process / server) along the side.

	<p>Looking at the first activity for Server #1, we can see a user was logging
	in &ndash; the whole action took about 0.8s; of which about 1/3 was checking the
	database, 1/3 was initialising their session, 1/6 was displaying the result
	("You logged in!"), and 1/6 was overhead. Hovering over one of the activity
	blocks, we can get more details &ndash; we can see that the initialising the session
	took ~300ms, it happened ~400ms after recording started, and it happened in login.py.

	<p>The next activity is in red &ndash; Context saw that an exception was raised
	while dealing with this request, so it has flagged it as an error. Errored
	activities can be analysed in exactly the same way as normal ones, the colour
	is just to make them stand out &ndash; you can see at a glance if the reason
	for something being fast is that it crashed.

	<h2>So how do I make it work?</h2>
	<p>For the full list of APIs and documentation, check out
	<a href="https://github.com/shish/context-apis">the Context APIs project</a>
	on GitHub.

	<p>Here's a quick example of a couple of languages:

	<style>
	.tabberlive TD,
	.tabber TD {
		vertical-align: top;
		padding: 16px;
	}
	UL.tabbernav {
		padding-bottom: 1px;
	}
	UL.tabbernav A {
		margin-bottom: 1px;
	}
	</style>
	<div class="tabber">
		<div class="tabbertab" title="Python (Decorators)">
			<table>
				<tr><td width="50%">
					Here's a program (In Python, though we also supply APIs for
					many other languages):
				</td><td width="50%">
					Here is the normal, manual way to add context to targeted
					sections of your code:
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td>
				<!--#include file="example1.py.html"-->
				</td><td>
				<!--#include file="example2.py.html"-->
				</td></tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<div class="tabbertab" title="Python (Profiler)">
			<div style="padding: 16px;">
				If you really don't like annotating your code, and you use Python, we also
				have a profiler-based API, which will (by default) log every function call.

				<!--#include file="example3.py.html"-->
			</div>
		</div>
		<!--
		<div class="tabbertab" title="Java (Profiler)">
			<div style="padding: 16px;">
				<p>(Warning: this is an experimental interface. It is also horrifically
				slow. Profiling of command line apps is just about tolerable; for anything
				large, like Swing apps, the regular interface is about 200x faster)
				<p>For Java too, there is a profiler interface &mdash; take a program with
				no annotations at all:

				<!- -#include file="ExampleProfile.java.html" - ->

				<p>And tell Java to load Context as a debugging agent:

				<p><tt>java -agentpath:./libcontext.so=example.ctxt,org.shishnet org.shishnet.ExampleProfile</tt>

				<p>The syntax for -agentpath is -agentpath:<i>library</i>=<i>options</i> and context
				takes two options &ndash; a filename to log to, and a string to match against package
				names. Java will make around 6000 function calls setting itself up, before it gets to
				running your code, so filtering down to only your own packages is recommended...

	<p>Open up the log file in Context, and it's clear where the program
	is spending most of its time:
	<p><img class="head" src="example.png">
	<p>You probably could have guessed that by reading the code, but when your
	code becomes more complicated, Context remains as simple as ever. <!--  -->
	<!-- Look at <a href="FIXME">the real life example</a> to see how Context
	can handle larger, more complicated programs. -->
	<a href="http://www.civicboom.com/" target="blank">Civicboom</a> is using it to hunt for
	performance issues in a ~50kloc codebase with no difficulty at all :-)
	<h3>Annotations? Bleh.</h3>
	Yeah, when trying to get a large amount of detail out of a small amount of
	code, as in these examples, the annotations do seem a little overwhelming;
	but you rarely need to annotate anywhere near that much &mdash; at civicboom
	we've found that three annotations (start/end of page view, start/end of
	database query, and start/end of template rendering) has helped us diagnose
	about 90% of our performance problems. Check out <a href="#example1">the
	full-size app example</a> to see how much benefit you can get from 6
	annotations over 40k lines of code.
</div>

<div id="extras">
	<h2>So; simple, solid, can it do anything else?</h2>
	<p>There are a few cool things that might not be immediately obvious:
	<ul>
	<li>While Context was first developed for web apps, it works on all
	software; it's even been used to profile itself ;-)
	<li>As well as logging activities and sub-activities, you can log
	bookmark points to make the data easier to navigate. For instance, when
	profiling a website you can stick a bookmark at the beginning of
	every page load. You can then easily skip backwards and forwards,
	or pick a specific bookmark from the list
	(<a rel="lightbox" title="Navigating Context with bookmarks" href="bookmarks.gif">Video</a>).
	<li>Logged text doesn't need to be static &mdash;
	instead of logging "Searching for user" you
	can log "Searching for user named Bob within 3 miles of Kentucky".
	Then if some searches are taking longer than others, you can see
	what it is about those searches that makes them different
	(<a rel="lightbox" title="Extra details in activity logs" href="details.png">Screenshot</a>).
	<li>You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, or click on an activity
	to focus on it, allowing you to easily see the sub-activities in detail
	(<a rel="lightbox" title="Navigating a Context file" href="zoom.gif">Video</a>).
	<li>Context makes an <i>excellent</i> companion for <a href="/monkeys">Monkey Swarm</a> -
	with a hundred monkeys bashing away at your front end, giving you warnings
	like "Page X is unusually slow", you can use Context to look at Page X
	and see precisely what's happening under the hood.

	<h2>Can I see how this works on a real problem?</h2>
	<p>Sure; for our first trick, let's find a performance problem with the
	open source gallery software, <a href="https://github.com/shish/shimmie2">Shimmie</a>.
	We don't know that there actually are any problems, but all software
	can be faster, right?
	<p>First things first, let's make the most basic of charts, showing the
	start and end of each page load. Opening up index.php:
	<!--#include file="shimmie1.php.html"-->
	<p>So what does this look like?
	<p><img src="shimmie1-770x.png">
	<p>Pretty much what we expected, pages are being loaded, 10-20 per second,
	no errors. But we knew that already; the web server logs access times, and
	there are plenty of tools for doing shallow analysis. Let's go a little bit
	deeper to see where Context shines.

	<p>For our next step, a little explanation of Shimmie internals &mdash;
	Shimmie is at its core a generic event-based framework for PHP; there are
	a set of plugins set up to listen for events (they have functions like
	onPageRequest(), onImageUpload(), onUserView(), etc), and a set of events.
	When the framework is loaded, it launches an InitExtEvent which triggers
	the plugins to initialise, and then a PageRequestEvent with details
	of the page being requested. This triggers a chain reaction of events being
	fired off in all directions, until eventually the reaction fizzles out,
	and the resulting page is delivered to the user.
	<p>Being an event-based framework, let's see what events are being sent
	where, and how long the plugins take to process them:
	<!--#include file="shimmie2.php.html"-->
	<p><img src="shimmie2-770x.png">
	<p>Now that we can see the stacks, two things jump out &mdash; the
	first is that InitExtEvent (which should be fairly instant) is taking a while
	to process, as it seems to be getting stuck in the IPBan plugin. The second
	is that the CommentList plugin is sending out hundreds of TextFormatting
	events, and even though they only take a millisecond each, a thousand of them
	per second starts to add up (the solid dark green block is events constantly
	starting and ending).

	<p>CommentList is only active for some pages, where IPBan does processing on
	every single page load &mdash; so let's look at IPBan first. Currently it takes
	about 100ms to load the list of banned IP addresses and scan through them.
	<p>Since we want to do some advanced pattern matching and remain compatible
	with simple databases like SQLite and MySQL, we need to load all the active bans
	and process them inside PHP. We don't need to load them from our already-stressed
	database though. Let's take some load off the database by putting the list in
	memcached:
	<!--#include file="shimmie3.php.html"-->
	<p>Now what do the stacks look like?
	<p><img src="shimmie3-770x.png">
	<p>Bans now take 8ms to process; we could probably improve that (lazily loading
	the user details rather than doing a JOIN on the whole table,
	for instance...), but it's fast enough that it pales in comparison to the rest
	of the processing.

	<p>Next on the list, the thousands of tiny events. Looking through the list of
	plugins, it seems that only the core formatter does any formatting, so sending
	out an event to alert everyone that formatting is happening is unnecessary.
	For a simple fix, let's just comment out the sending of that event. What's the
	result now?
	<p><img src="shimmie4-770x.png">
	<p>From ~250ms per page down to 65ms, our server has gone from ~80% CPU use down
	to 20% &mdash; and with Context telling us exactly
	where our attention is needed, the whole process took under 15 minutes :-)
